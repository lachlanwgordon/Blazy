# Blazy
Experimenting with Blazor Client Side. This site is hosted using Azure blob storage static website. You can view it at https://blazort.z26.web.core.windows.net/

So far it is basically just the File>New Blazor Template with an extra page for subscribe alerts.

The subscribe alerts page is a proof-of-concept page to test if client side Blazor can be used with a transperant background to display content overlayed in Twitch stream.

If you want to try it in your twitch stream add a browser source with the url https://blazort.z26.web.core.windows.net/subscribealert

As this project matures I will be adding instructions on how to set up hosting on Azure using Static Website Blobs. These scale incredibly easy and cost almost nothing, this is one of the benefits Blazor client side.

Here it is in actions, sorry about th quality, I'll get better at this stuff, I promise.
