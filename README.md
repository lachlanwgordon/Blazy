# Blazy
Experimenting with Blazor Client Side. This site is hosted using Azure blob storage static website. You can view it at https://blazort.z26.web.core.windows.net/

So far it is basically just the File>New Blazor Template with an extra page for subscribe alerts.

The subscribe alerts page is a proof-of-concept page to test if client side Blazor can be used with a transperant background to display content overlayed in Twitch stream.

If you want to try it in your twitch stream add a browser source with the url https://blazort.z26.web.core.windows.net/subscribealert
